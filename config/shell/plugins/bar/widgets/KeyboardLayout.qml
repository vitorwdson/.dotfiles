  // (intel-hid-events, dell-wmi-hotkeys), HID consumer controls, and Bluetooth
  // AVRCP endpoints from a pair of headphones all arrive holding the seat's
  // layout list, and they sort ahead of the keyboard being typed on. The click
  // then advances a device nobody types on; that device is now the furthest
  // along, so it wins the next reading too, and the label describes it while the
  // real keyboard never moved.

  // An absolute index rather than "next", because "next" advances each device
  // from wherever it already sits: a seat that has drifted apart stays drifted
  // and merely inverts. One index converges them in a single click, and a seat
  // in lockstep is what leaves the reading nothing to disagree about afterwards.
